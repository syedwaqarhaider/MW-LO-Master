# loanservice

This is a "microservice" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture.

This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with the Registry. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to the Registry at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761). For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with the Registry][].

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    ./mvnw




## Building for production

To optimize the loanservice application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war


## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a oracle database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/oracle.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/oracle.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
